# SASonDS
This repository contains SAS macros useful for data management at Danmarks Statistik (DS).

Considerable overlap with the corresponding collection for Sundhedsdatastyrelsen in the repository SASonSDS as functionality is equal but datasets delivered from DS and SDS does differ in naming of variables and sometimes also in table structure.

It is advised to place the entire repository in a folder called SAS, with the path given in the file common.sas.
To deploy download the entire repository as zip and upload to DS according to current guideline, with the instruction to unzip in the SAS folder.

The suite was originally develloped in context of Aalborg Thrombosis Research Unit, Aalborg University and Unit of Thrombosis and Drug Reseach, Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark.
